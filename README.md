== Open Library Visualizations with D3.js

=== Goals

This project is an experiment in working with large datasets of semi-formatted data
made available by the [OpenLibrary.org](https://openlibrary.org) project. 

The project experiments with the following technologies:

* [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) (4.1.x) as an API server and to handle the underlying ETL 
  (extract / transform / load) operations
* [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org) a specification for the formatting of JSON responses
* [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com) (2.5.x) as a single page JavaScript framework
* [D3.js](https://d3js.org) (4.1.x) for visualizations

=== License

This project is available under the MIT license. The use of the OpenLibrary.org data files
[Open Library Data Dumps](https://openlibrary.org/developers/dumps) is subject to the 
Internet Archive's [Terms of Use](https://archive.org/about/terms.php).

=== TODO

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
